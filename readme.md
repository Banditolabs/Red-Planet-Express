## Documenting Challenges and Solutions - Issues

Whenever you run into an issue you should create an issue on your repository (you'll see issues in the menu at the top of the screen). Create the issue and make comments as you learn new things to solve the problem. This becomes something that can help you and other users in the future.
``` javascript
let i = Math.floor(Math.random() * 856) //Should the max here be the length value of the array? 
    //How would I handel an array of unknown length?
```
``` jquery
firstSlide.attr("src",`${firstPic}`) 
```
